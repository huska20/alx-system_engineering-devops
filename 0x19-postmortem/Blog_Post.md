Postmortem: Web Stack Blackout on Oct 13, 2023
Term: Oct 13, 2023, 2:00 PM - Oct 13, 2023, 4:00 PM (UTC)

Influence:

The web application experienced total margin time during the blackout.
Clients couldn't get to the help, bringing about a 100 percent client blackout.
Clients detailed seeing a "Administration Inaccessible" message.
Main driver:
The blackout was made by an unforeseen expansion in rush hour gridlock due an unexpected flood of new clients after a well known web-based entertainment force to be reckoned with referenced our foundation. The expanded burden on the web servers set off asset depletion, prompting the blackout.

Timeline:

2:00 PM: The issue was identified while the checking framework set off a high server load alert.
2:05 PM: The tasks group began researching the issue, thinking a server misconfiguration.
2:30 PM: Beginning examination uncovered no server misconfiguration. It was thought to be a minor traffic spike.
2:45 PM: The heap proceeded to rise, and the group understood this was in excess of a minor spike.
3:00 PM: The occurrence was heightened to the whole designing group as the help's accessibility deteriorated.
3:30 PM: Misleadingly, the group thought a DDoS assault and zeroed in on relieving it.
3:45 PM: Obviously it was anything but a DDoS assault as no pernicious traffic designs were distinguished.
4:00 PM: The issue was settled by increasing the web server framework to deal with the expanded traffic.
Underlying driver and Goal:
The main driver was an unforeseen flood in rush hour gridlock. The web servers couldn't deal with the heap, bringing about a total help blackout.

To determine the issue, the group quickly increased the server foundation, adding more assets like computer chip and Slam. This guaranteed that the application could deal with the expanded traffic with next to no presentation issues.

Restorative and Safeguard Measures:

Execute computerized scaling: Set up auto-scaling to progressively change server assets in light of traffic. This will forestall comparable blackouts later on.
Improved Checking: Further develop our checking framework to give early admonitions about surprising traffic designs.
Load Testing: Consistently perform load testing to distinguish the application's greatest limit.
Content Conveyance Organization (CDN): Use a CDN to offload a portion of the traffic, diminishing the burden on the web servers.
Occurrence Reaction Plan: Foster an unmistakable episode reaction intend to smooth out correspondence and activities during blackouts.
In rundown, the blackout was a significant opportunity for growth. We found that the framework wasn't ready for abrupt traffic spikes. By executing computerized scaling, further developing checking, and directing customary burden testing, we mean to forestall such issues from now on.
